react is a JS framework

allows to build very dynamic and interactive websites and UI

uses the virtual DOM (lightweight copy of the actual DOM)

when state of a component changes => virtual DOM changes first => react would compare virtual and actual DOM => update parts that need to be updated.

Components - 
- reusable piece of code that can be used to build elements on the page.
- allows us to break down complex UIs, makes easier to maintain and scale
- components can get props passed in and can hoold their own state

State
- represents the data a component manages internally
- ex: form input data, fetched data, UI-related data (useState())

Hooks
- useState <= most used
- useEffect <= most used
- useRef
- useReducer

React uses JSX within its components

has div with id of root in index.html, that holds all the code from react




++++++++++++ CODE +++++++++++++++

when making a list, each item must have a key prop or id

when importing components to app, they can be named anything you want

rafce for boiler plate set up

if importing from one component to the next,
'./components/Card' gives an error
instead => do this
'./Card'

State

component state - <HomeCard/>

app lvl or global state - relates to entire App, pass down to components


useState lets you set a default variable

name of state
name of function called to change that state
const [showFullDescription, setShowFullDescription] = useState(false);
