react is a JS framework

allows to build very dynamic and interactive websites and UI

uses the virtual DOM (lightweight copy of the actual DOM)

when state of a component changes => virtual DOM changes first => react would compare virtual and actual DOM => update parts that need to be updated.

Components - 
- reusable piece of code that can be used to build elements on the page.
- allows us to break down complex UIs, makes easier to maintain and scale
- components can get props passed in and can hoold their own state

State
- represents the data a component manages internally
- ex: form input data, fetched data, UI-related data (useState())

Hooks
- useState <= most used
- useEffect <= most used
- useRef
- useReducer

React uses JSX within its components
